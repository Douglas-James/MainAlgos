# Security Statement

We are committed to maintaining a secure codebase. Currently, the only identified security concern involves Jest tests. To mitigate risks, ensure that all Jest tests are properly configured and executed within a secure and isolated environment. Regularly review and update your test configurations to align with best practices.
