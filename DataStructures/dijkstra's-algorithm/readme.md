# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic algorithm in computer science used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It works on graphs with non-negative edge weights and is widely used in data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and graph traversal.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** Start from a source node, setting its distance to zero and all others to infinity.
2. **Visit Nodes:** Repeatedly select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance.
3. **Update Distances:** For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance. If it's smaller than the previously known distance, update it.
4. **Repeat:** Continue until all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to the target node is found.

## Applications in the Real World

- **GPS Navigation:** Finding the shortest driving route between two locations.
- **Network Routing:** Determining the fastest path for data packets in computer networks.
- **Robotics:** Path planning for robots to avoid obstacles and reach a destination efficiently.
- **Game Development:** AI pathfinding for characters to navigate maps.

Dijkstra's algorithm is fundamental in fields where optimal pathfinding is required, making it a key concept in data structures and algorithms.
