# Data Structures

## Recommendations

Create a `coding-exercise` folder to practice implementing different data structures. For each exercise, make a separate subfolder with its own JavaScript file. In each JavaScript file, include a description of the data structure or problem as a comment at the top, followed by your implementation code. Use this space as your playground to experiment, learn, and deepen your understanding of various data structures.
