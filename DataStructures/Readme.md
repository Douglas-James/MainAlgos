# Data Structures

## Introduction

Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are essential for designing efficient algorithms and play a crucial role in software development.

## Types of Data Structures

| Data Structure   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Arrays**       | A collection of elements identified by index or key. It is one of the simplest data structures and is used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.             |
| **Linked Lists** | A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.                              |
| **Stacks**       | A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added and removed only from the top of the stack.                                                 |
| **Queues**       | A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.                                                       |
| **Trees**        | A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root. Each node has zero or more child nodes, and nodes with no children are called leaves.                         |
| **Graphs**       | A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. Graphs can be used to represent networks, such as social networks or communication networks.                               |
| **Hash Tables**  | A data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. |

## Conclusion

Understanding different data structures and their use cases is fundamental for efficient problem-solving and algorithm design. Each data structure has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of data structure can significantly affect the performance of an application.

## Algorithms

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the subproblems overlap, meaning that the same subproblems are solved multiple times. Dynamic programming saves the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations, making the algorithm more efficient.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It is commonly used in routing and navigation systems. The algorithm works by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance, updating the distances of its neighbors, and marking the node as visited.

### Graph Traversal

Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting all the nodes in a graph. There are two primary methods of graph traversal:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all the neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Both methods are used for various applications, such as searching for a specific node, finding connected components, and solving puzzles.
