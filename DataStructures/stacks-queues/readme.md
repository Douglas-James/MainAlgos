# Stacks and Queues in Data Structures

## Stacks

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks support two main operations:

- `push`: Add an element to the top.
- `pop`: Remove the top element.

### Real-World Applications of Stacks

- **Undo functionality** in text editors (recent actions are undone first).
- **Backtracking algorithms** (e.g., navigating browser history).
- **Expression evaluation** (parsing mathematical expressions).

## Queues

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed. Queues support two main operations:

- `enqueue`: Add an element to the end.
- `dequeue`: Remove the element from the front.

### Real-World Applications of Queues

- **Task scheduling** (e.g., print queues, CPU task scheduling).
- **Breadth-first search** in graphs.
- **Customer service systems** (serving customers in the order they arrive).

Both stacks and queues are fundamental for managing data in a controlled and predictable way, making them essential for solving various computational and real-world problems.
