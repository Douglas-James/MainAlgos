# Graph Traversal in Data Structures

Graph traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes (vertices) in a graph data structure in a systematic way. It is fundamental for exploring, searching, and analyzing graphs, which are collections of nodes connected by edges.

## Types of Graph Traversal

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**

- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Uses a stack (explicitly or via recursion).

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

- Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level.
- Uses a queue.

## Real-World Applications

- **Social Networks:** Finding friends, suggesting connections, or analyzing communities.
- **Web Crawling:** Navigating web pages via hyperlinks.
- **Network Routing:** Finding shortest paths or detecting connectivity in computer networks.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Discovering related products or content.
- **Pathfinding in Maps:** GPS navigation and route planning.

Graph traversal algorithms are essential tools for solving problems involving relationships and connections in various domains.
