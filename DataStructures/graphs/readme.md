# Graphs in Data Structures

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (also called vertices) and a set of edges connecting pairs of nodes. Graphs can be **directed** (edges have a direction) or **undirected** (edges have no direction), and may also be **weighted** (edges have values) or **unweighted**.

## Key Concepts

- **Vertex (Node):** Fundamental unit or point in a graph.
- **Edge:** Connection between two vertices.
- **Adjacency:** Relationship between two nodes connected by an edge.
- **Path:** Sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.

## Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph):** Edges have a direction.
- **Weighted Graph:** Edges carry weights (values).
- **Unweighted Graph:** Edges do not carry weights.

## Real-World Applications

Graphs are widely used to model relationships and connections in various domains:

- **Social Networks:** Users are nodes; friendships or follows are edges.
- **Web Page Links:** Web pages are nodes; hyperlinks are directed edges.
- **Transportation Networks:** Cities are nodes; roads, flights, or routes are edges.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Products or users as nodes; similarities or interactions as edges.
- **Network Routing:** Routers/computers as nodes; connections as edges.

Graphs are fundamental in computer science for representing and solving problems involving networks, relationships, and connections.
