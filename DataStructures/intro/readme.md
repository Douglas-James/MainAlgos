# Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that organize, manage, and store data efficiently for various operations. They provide a way to structure data so that it can be accessed and modified effectively.

## What is an "Intro" in Data Structures?

An introduction to data structures covers the basic types, their properties, and how they solve common problems in programming. It lays the foundation for understanding more complex algorithms and systems.

## Common Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Store elements in a fixed-size, sequential collection.
- **Linked Lists**: Elements are connected using pointers, allowing dynamic memory usage.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Manage data in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, respectively.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures for representing relationships.
- **Hash Tables**: Provide fast data retrieval using key-value pairs.
- **Graphs**: Model networks of connected nodes.

## Real-World Applications

- **Databases** use trees and hash tables for indexing and searching.
- **Social Networks** represent users and connections as graphs.
- **Operating Systems** use queues for task scheduling.
- **Navigation Systems** use graphs for route finding.
- **Text Editors** use stacks for undo/redo functionality.

Understanding data structures is essential for writing efficient code and solving complex problems in software development.
