# Singly Linked List

A **singly linked list** is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The list starts with a head node and ends when a node points to `null`.

## Why Use Singly Linked Lists?

- **Dynamic Size:** Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size during runtime.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Adding or removing elements (especially at the beginning) is efficient, as it only requires updating links.
- **Memory Utilization:** Memory is allocated as needed for each node.

## Structure

```plaintext
[Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> ... -> null
```

## Real-World Applications

- **Implementing Stacks and Queues:** Linked lists are often used to build stack and queue data structures.
- **Navigation Systems:** Used in applications like web browsers (back/forward navigation) or undo functionality in editors.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Operating systems use linked lists to manage free and used memory blocks.
- **Polynomial Arithmetic:** Used to represent and manipulate polynomials efficiently.

## Example Use Case

Suppose you are building a music playlist app. Each song can be represented as a node in a singly linked list, allowing users to add, remove, or reorder songs efficiently.

Singly linked lists are a versatile and essential tool for solving many real-world problems that require dynamic and efficient data management.
