# Search Algorithms

This section covers various search algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Below are the details of the three main search algorithms in this folder:

## Binary Search

**File:** `binary_search.js`

**Description:**
Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

**Introduction:**
I know this one was introduced to efficiently search through sorted arrays.

## Linear Search

**File:** `linear_search.js`

**Description:**
Linear search is the simplest search algorithm. It works by iterating through each element in the list and checking if it matches the target value. It is not as efficient as binary search for large datasets but is straightforward and easy to implement.

## String Search

**File:** `string_search.js`

**Description:**
String search algorithms are used to find occurrences of a substring within a main string. There are various algorithms for string searching, each with different performance characteristics. This file contains implementations of some common string search algorithms.
