# Understanding Big O Notation

In this section, we have three files: `example.js`, `example_a.js`, and `example_b.js`. Each of these files demonstrates different aspects of Big O notation and its importance in coding.

## Why Big O Notation Matters

Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of algorithms. It helps us understand the time and space complexity of our code, which is crucial for writing efficient and scalable programs. By analyzing the Big O notation of our algorithms, we can make informed decisions about which approach to use based on the problem constraints.

### `example.js`

This file contains a basic example of an algorithm with a linear time complexity, O(n). It demonstrates how the execution time increases linearly with the input size.

### `example_a.js`

In this file, we explore an algorithm with a quadratic time complexity, O(n^2). It shows how nested loops can significantly impact the performance of our code, especially with larger input sizes.

### `example_b.js`

This file presents an algorithm with logarithmic time complexity, O(log n). It highlights the efficiency of algorithms that reduce the problem size with each iteration, such as binary search.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying Big O notation is an essential skill for any programmer. It not only helps you write better code but also enables you to optimize existing solutions and tackle complex problems more effectively. By studying the examples in these files, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of algorithmic efficiency.
