# Section 7: Merge Sort

This section is focused on Merge Sort. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works as follows:

1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves until each sub-array contains a single element.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each sub-array.
3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted sub-arrays to produce the final sorted array.

The merging process involves comparing the smallest elements of each sub-array and combining them in sorted order. This ensures that the final array is sorted.

Merge Sort is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) and is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
