# Algorithms

## Overview

Algorithms are step-by-step methods for solving problems. They are crucial in computer science for performing tasks efficiently.

## Types of Algorithms

| **Category**        | **Description**                                                | **Examples**                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fast Algorithms** | Solve problems quickly by minimizing time complexity.          | - **Binary Search**: Quickly finds an item in a sorted list.                                              |
|                     |                                                                | - **Quick Sort**: Sorts elements using a divide-and-conquer approach.                                     |
| **Slow Algorithms** | Have higher time complexity and take longer to solve problems. | - **Bubble Sort**: Compares and swaps adjacent elements to sort a list.                                   |
|                     |                                                                | - **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element from an unsorted list and moves it to the sorted part. |
| **Recursion**       | When a function calls itself to solve a problem.               | - **Factorial Calculation**: Multiplies a number by the factorial of the number minus one.                |
|                     |                                                                | - **Fibonacci Sequence**: Sums the two preceding numbers to get the next number in the sequence.          |

## Test

To ensure the correctness and efficiency of algorithms, it is important to write and run tests. Using a testing framework like `npm test` can help automate this process.

### Example

To run tests for your algorithms, you can use the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

This will execute the test scripts defined in your `package.json` file, allowing you to verify that your algorithms work as expected.

### Benefits

- **Automation**: Automates the testing process, saving time and effort.
- **Reliability**: Ensures that your algorithms produce the correct results.
- **Maintenance**: Makes it easier to maintain and update your codebase.

By incorporating tests into your development workflow, you can improve the quality and reliability of your algorithms.
