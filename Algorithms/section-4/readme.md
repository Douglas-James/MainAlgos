# Section 4: Bubble Sort

In this section, we will focus on the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## How Bubble Sort Works

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements.
3. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.
5. Continue this process until the end of the list.
6. Repeat the entire process for the entire list until no swaps are needed.

## Example

Given the list: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

- First pass: [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
- Second pass: [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
- Third pass: [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
- Fourth pass: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

The list is now sorted.
