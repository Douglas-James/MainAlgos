# Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It specifically describes the worst-case scenario and helps to understand the upper limits of an algorithm.

## Common Big O Notations

| Notation   | Name              | Description                                                             | Graphical Representation         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant Time     | The runtime is constant and does not change with the size of the input. | ![O(1)](images/01.png)           |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic Time  | The runtime grows logarithmically with the size of the input.           | ![O(log n)](images/Ologn.png)    |
| O(n)       | Linear Time       | The runtime grows linearly with the size of the input.                  | ![O(n)](images/On.png)           |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic Time | The runtime grows in proportion to n log n.                             | ![O(n log n)](images/Onlogn.png) |
| O(n^2)     | Quadratic Time    | The runtime grows quadratically with the size of the input.             | ![O(n^2)](images/On2.png)        |
| O(2^n)     | Exponential Time  | The runtime grows exponentially with the size of the input.             | ![O(2^n)](images/O2n.png)        |
| O(n!)      | Factorial Time    | The runtime grows factorially with the size of the input.               | ![O(n!)](images/On!.png)         |
