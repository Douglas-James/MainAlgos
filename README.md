## Jest Docs

For more information on how to use Jest, refer to the [official Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started).

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

### Folder Structure

The `Test` folder contains the `main.test.js` file, which is responsible for testing your code. The `index.js` file export the code to the `Test` folder to be tested.

```markdown
- /Test
  - main.test.js
- index.js
```

If you fork this repository, GitHub Actions will automatically run `npm test`, which might be challenging to understand initially. Please visit the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more information.

This will execute the test scripts defined in your `package.json` file, allowing you to verify that your algorithms work as expected.
