## Testing with Jest

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. Jest is a powerful JavaScript Testing Framework focused on simplicity and ease of use. For more details, refer to the [official Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started).

### Folder Structure

The `Test` folder contains the `main.test.js` file, which is responsible for testing your code. The `index.js` file exports the code to the `Test` folder for testing.

```plaintext
- /Test
  - main.test.js
- index.js
```

If you fork this repository, GitHub Actions will automatically run `npm test`. This might seem complex at first, so check out the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for guidance.

These tests ensure that your algorithms function as expected by executing the test scripts defined in your `package.json` file.
